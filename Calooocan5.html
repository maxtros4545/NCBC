                        "God used NCBC to help me learn new theological and Biblical skills, unlearn personal hindrances to spiritual growth, and relearn the value of accountability and community. Through the teachings and fellowship at NCBC, I have gained a deeper understanding of Scripture and have been equipped with practical tools to apply in my daily life. It has been a place where I’ve not only discovered new perspectives on God’s Word but also recognized the areas where I needed to grow in my faith. The community has been a source of support, encouragement, and challenge, helping me to overcome spiritual obstacles and walk more closely with God. The emphasis on accountability has also taught me the importance of surrounding myself with fellow believers who can help keep me focused and grounded in my faith journey. NCBC has truly been a transformative experience, deepening my relationship with God and with others."

        "The training in NCBC is not confined to the classroom. It extends beyond lectures and textbooks into real-life experiences that shape and deepen my faith. Moreover, through my daily interactions with people in NCBC’s intercultural community, I gained valuable insights into God’s work in other cultures. Each conversation, story, and perspective has broadened my understanding of how God is moving across the world and has deepened my appreciation for His global mission. These experiences have challenged me to remain faithful to God’s call and the Great Commission, inspiring me to actively live out my faith with a heart for reaching people of all backgrounds. The diversity within the community has also taught me the importance of embracing and learning from others, recognizing that God’s work is not limited by borders, but transcends cultures and languages. I am constantly reminded that our role as believers is to share the love of Christ in every context, and this experience has ignited a greater passion for missions and serving others"
